## 🧠 Overview

**Framer** is a Windows-based design environment created for building modern, interactive interfaces that behave like real products. It allows designers to move beyond static mockups and experiment with layout, motion, and user flow in a single workspace.

The platform is centered on visual creation combined with live interaction. Elements respond instantly to changes, making it easy to test animations, transitions, and responsive behavior while designing. This approach helps teams evaluate ideas earlier and with greater accuracy.

Framer fits naturally into UI and product design workflows where speed and realism matter. Its streamlined interface and interactive focus make it a practical tool for designing, testing, and presenting interface concepts on Windows systems.

## Additional Information for Windows Users

Framer helps bridge the gap between concept and execution by allowing designers to test how interfaces feel, not just how they look. This reduces iteration time and improves communication between designers and stakeholders.

For Windows users working in UI, UX, or product design, Framer provides a responsive and expressive platform for transforming ideas into interactive experiences.
